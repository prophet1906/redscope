By accessing this blog, you agree to avoid using these techniques on or against systems you do not own or have express permission. Doing so is illegal and can land you in jail. Also, using some of the scanning tools covered here could be illegal in some areas – Always follow your regional and country laws. Becoming a real penetration tester takes years of training and education. These articles demonstrate a single technique in a test environment and in no way encompass all the risks you would encounter using these techniques in a live production environment. Always know and understand the full impact of any tool you use before attempting to use it yourself. Techniques and software change over time and may break the validity of some notes.
