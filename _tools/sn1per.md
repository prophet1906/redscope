# Basic Usage

{: .warning }
I am doing passive scan on **nasa.gov** and active scan on **globomantics.com** here.

{: .info }
**Sn1per** only runs with root shell elevation.

**SOC** - security operations center

```shell
sudo -i
# active + passive scan -> creates noise
# only do when you have authorization
# easily detected by SOC team
sniper -t globomantics.com
ls /usr/share/sniper/loot/workspace
# check vulnerabilities/sc0pe-all-vulnerabilities-sorted.txt
# these vulnerabilities list can be used to automate exploit
# passive scan + osint(linkedin, twitter, etc) + recon mode
sniper -t nasa.gov -m stealth -o -re
ls /usr/share/sniper/loot/workspace/nasa.gov/reports
# check osint/msf-emails-nasa.gov.txt
```
